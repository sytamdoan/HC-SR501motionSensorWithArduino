# HC-SR501motionSensorWithArduino
This project works with a HC-SR501 to detect motion. There are three lights indicating the state of the arduino. There red light indicates
delay before the PIR sensor runs and after the PIR sensor detects something. Delays are overall necessary to make sure the temperature taken
is consistant. The HC mode is switched to "No repeating mode".
